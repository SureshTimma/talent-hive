            <h2>1. What is Python?</h2>
            <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <h2>2. What is Java?</h2>
            <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <h2>3. What are the key features of Python?</h2>
            <p>Key features of Python include its simplicity, extensive libraries, and dynamic typing.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <h2>4. What are the key features of Java?</h2>
            <p>Java is known for its platform independence, strong memory management, and rich standard libraries.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <h2>5. Is Python statically typed or dynamically typed?</h2>
            <p>Python is dynamically typed, meaning variable types are determined at runtime.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <h2>6. Is Java statically typed or dynamically typed?</h2>
            <p>Java is statically typed, meaning variable types must be declared at compile-time.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <h2>7. What are Python's main applications?</h2>
            <p>Python is widely used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and automation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <h2>8. What are Java's main applications?</h2>
            <p>Java is commonly used in web development, enterprise applications, mobile applications (Android), and cloud-based services.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <h2>9. How does Python handle memory management?</h2>
            <p>Python uses automatic memory management through reference counting and a built-in garbage collector.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <h2>10. How does Java handle memory management?</h2>
            <p>Java manages memory through an automatic garbage collection process, which removes unused objects from memory.</p>
